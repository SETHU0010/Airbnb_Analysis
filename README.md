# Airbnb Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes Airbnb data to uncover insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. By leveraging MongoDB Atlas for data storage, Python for data processing and visualization, and Streamlit for building interactive web applications, the project provides comprehensive analyses and visualizations. Additionally, tools like Power BI or Tableau are used to create dynamic dashboards that facilitate data exploration and decision-making.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
- Understanding of MongoDB and NoSQL databases
- Basic knowledge of web application development (Streamlit)
- Experience with data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Familiarity with geospatial analysis (GeoPandas, Folium)
- Basic understanding of dashboard creation in Tableau or Power BI

## Workflow
1. **MongoDB Setup**: 
   - Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account.
   - Set up a cluster and load the Airbnb sample data.

2. **Data Retrieval and Cleaning**:
   - Connect to MongoDB Atlas and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types.

3. **Geospatial Visualization**:
   - Develop a Streamlit web application to create interactive maps.
   - Visualize the distribution of Airbnb listings and allow users to explore prices, ratings, and other factors.

4. **Price Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Analyze how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons.
   - Create dynamic plots and charts to explore price trends and correlations.

5. **Availability Analysis by Season**:
   - Analyze seasonal variations in the availability of Airbnb listings.
   - Visualize occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations.

6. **Location-Based Insights**:
   - Investigate price variations across different locations.
   - Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods.

7. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Develop interactive visualizations that allow users to filter and drill down into the data.

8. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Create a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI.
   - Combine different visualizations to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb data.

## Required Python Libraries
